This repository demonstrates a common issue with nested routes in React Router v6. The problem occurs when a nested route is defined within a parent route, but the nested route does not render when navigating to its corresponding path.  The solution involves correctly defining the nested route's path and ensuring the parent route uses the <Route> component with the `element` prop appropriately.
